# MPC Rendezvous and Contact Simulator

**An entry-level MPC-based microgravity simulator**

This repository provides the simulation and control framework developed during the Master's thesis *"Model Predictive Control-based Rendezvous and Contact of Autonomous Space Vehicles"*, by Rodrigo Silva. It models various autonomous space vehicle scenarios in a planar or 3D microgravity environment, using Model Predictive Control (MPC) with CasADi.

Developed as part of a joint research effort between KTH Royal Institute of Technology (Sweden) and Instituto Superior Técnico, University of Lisbon (Portugal).

## ⚙ Installation

Make sure you have **Python 3.12.6** installed.

Install the required packages using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

##  Running a Scenario

Scenarios can be launched using `run_simulator.py`. The interface will soon support command-line arguments, but for now, modify the script directly to choose:

- The simulation dimensionality (`2D` or `3D`)
- The desired scenario name

Example scenario files:
- `entry_angle_v2`
- `obs_avoidance`
- `entry_plus_obs`
- `dock_alignement`
- `fugue`
- `multistage`
- `ros_scenario`

To view animations and plots, make sure to set the `show = True` flag inside the scenario script.
To save, the same logic goes for the `save = True` flag inside the scenario script.

## Reproducing Thesis Results

A mapping between each thesis figure and its corresponding scenario configuration will be provided in [`results/reproducibility.md`](results/reproducibility.md). This will allow others to replicate the experimental results, both from simulations and laboratory data.
